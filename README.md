### Curses.hx  
A library for interfacing with Curses APIs in various languages via Haxe. So you can make pretty terminal applications.    

Curses is a library for writing GUI-like interfaces in terminal applications.  

**This repository is very new, so not many targets are currently supported**  

#### Samples
+ [Simple Text Positioning](samples/py/simple)  
More to come.

#### Help! This doesn't work on Windows  
'True' Curses was never really ported to Windows. I'm aware of UniCurses for the python taraget which has a Windows implementation, but I'm not sure about others. Something to do more research on.     

#### Contributions  
Contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated. Let me know in some manner what you're working on so effort is not duplicated.  

If you have an issue relating to usage of the library, please check the samples directory, or search online for some Curses tutorials. Teaching you Curses is not this packages' job. If you're getting some bad behaviour, ie it's not compiling with input you believe is valid, submit an issue, or fork and issue a pull request!

#### TODO List  
+ Java / JCurses  
+ Cpp
+ Language-independent middleman  
+ Check UniCurses
+ More samples
